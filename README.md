After connecting to the motor through the i2c port on your device and powering the motor with 24vdc you can read the PID settings and change them if you wish. After you press set you will need to wait a couple seconds for the command to be written to non volatile flash memory and the drive reset. 
You can set a speed to spin the motor to test your settings. 
The Miranda is made by Overview.
